____________

The plot shown in AtlasXplore can be saved with or without background. The Genome Browser view or SeqLogo will be saved in a separate plot.

Users cam save the plots and graphs generated by the Genome Browser as image files. 

To save a plot in AtlasXplore, users can use the "Save" menu located at the top of the Genome Browser. This menu provides options for saving the current plot as an image file, such as a PNG or JPEG file. Users can also specify the plot size and resolution, as well as any additional options, such as the plot filename and the image format.

It is possible to save the Genome Browser view and SeqLogo in separate plots. 

When saving the Genome Browser view and SeqLogo in separate plots, users can choose to save either the Genome Browser view or the SeqLogo as the main plot, and the other as an overlay plot. The overlay plot will be displayed on top of the main plot, allowing users to view and compare the Genome Browser view and SeqLogo side by side.

Once the plots have been saved, they can be accessed and viewed using any image viewer or editor.
