Motif Search
_____________

For spatial ATAC data, AtlasXplore can be used to check the deviation score of certain motif/motifs. The deviation score is a bias-corrected measurement of how far the per unit/tixel accessibility of a given motif deviates from the expected accessibility based on the average of all units/tixels.

Motif search is a tool used to identify specific patterns or motifs in a sequence of DNA or protein. This can be useful for identifying genes or regulatory elements in a genome, or for detecting conserved sequence features across multiple species. The tool uses a motif, which can be entered as a sequence of letters or as a regular expression. The tool then searches the data set for instances of the pattern and returns the results in a table or list format.

In AtlasXplore, the deviation score is a measure of how far the accessibility of a given motif deviates from the expected accessibility based on the average of all units or tixels. This measure is used in spatial ATAC data, which is a type of genomic data that captures the accessibility of DNA in a three-dimensional space, such as within a cell.

The deviation score is calculated by first determining the per unit or tixel accessibility of the given motif. This is a measure of how accessible the motif is at each unit or tixel within the data set. The deviation score is then calculated by comparing the per unit or tixel accessibility of the motif to the expected accessibility based on the average of all units or tixels.

The deviation score is a bias-corrected measure, which means that it takes into account any biases or systematic errors that may be present in the data. This ensures that the deviation score is an accurate and reliable measure of the accessibility of the given motif.

In AtlasXplore, the deviation score can be used to check the accessibility of a given motif within a spatial ATAC data set. By comparing the deviation score to the expected accessibility, users can determine if the motif is more or less accessible than expected, and can gain insights into the underlying biology of the data.

**Features**
#####################
*Support for multiple data sources:* The motif search in BioDalliance allows users to search for motifs within local or remote data sets, including genomes, transcriptomes, and other types of biological data.

*Customizable patterns:* The motif search allows users to define their own patterns or motifs to search for, using either a sequence of letters or a regular expression. This makes the tool versatile and flexible, and allows users to search for a wide range of patterns and motifs.

*Search options:* The motif search includes a number of options that allow users to customize the search, such as the search direction, the search range, and the match score threshold. These options allow users to fine-tune the search and to optimize the results.

*Results visualization:* The motif search displays the results in a table or list format, with each row representing a different instance of the motif. The results can be sorted and filtered, and can be viewed in the context of the genome or other data set using the Genome Browser.

*Analysis tools:* The motif search includes tools for analyzing the results, such as tools for calculating the enrichment of the motif within the data set and tools for comparing the results to other data sets or to other regions of the genome.
