Motif Search
_____________

For spatial ATAC data, AtlasXplore can be used to check the deviation score of certain motif/motifs. The deviation score is a bias-corrected measurement of how far the per unit/tixel accessibility of a given motif deviates from the expected accessibility based on the average of all units/tixels.

Motif search is a tool used to identify specific patterns or motifs in a sequence of DNA or protein. This can be useful for identifying genes or regulatory elements in a genome, or for detecting conserved sequence features across multiple species. The tool uses a motif, which can be entered as a sequence of letters or as a regular expression. The tool then searches the data set for instances of the pattern and returns the results in a table or list format.

**Deviation Score**
######################
In AtlasXplore, the deviation score is a measure of how far the accessibility of a given motif deviates from the expected accessibility based on the average of all units or tixels. This measure is used in spatial ATAC data, which is a type of genomic data that captures the accessibility of DNA in a three-dimensional space, such as within a cell.

The deviation score is calculated by first determining the per unit or tixel accessibility of the given motif. This is a measure of how accessible the motif is at each unit or tixel within the data set. The deviation score is then calculated by comparing the per unit or tixel accessibility of the motif to the expected accessibility based on the average of all units or tixels.

The deviation score is a bias-corrected measure, which means that it takes into account any biases or systematic errors that may be present in the data. This ensures that the deviation score is an accurate and reliable measure of the accessibility of the given motif.

In AtlasXplore, the deviation score can be used to check the accessibility of a given motif within a spatial ATAC data set. By comparing the deviation score to the expected accessibility, users can determine if the motif is more or less accessible than expected, and can gain insights into the underlying biology of the data.

For example, users can use the motif search to identify genes or regulatory elements, or to detect conserved sequence features across multiple species.
