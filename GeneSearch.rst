Gene Search
____________

For spatial ATAC data, AtlasXplore can be used to check the gene score of certain gene/genes. The gene score is a prediction of how highly expressed a gene will be based on the accessibility of regulatory elements in the vicinity of the gene.

View heat maps for selected gene(s).
Feature table: Lists top 10 ranked genes in each of the clusters. 

To view the heat map, click any of the listed genes to automatically enter it in the search bar. If your gene of interest is not listed, you can enter it in the search bar. 
Click the gene in the search bar so that it turns orange and click ‘show’. 
Now you’ll be able to view the heat map for the selected gene and repeat the process to view multiple genes at once.

To view the gene activity score or the sum of the scores, hover over any tixel.
