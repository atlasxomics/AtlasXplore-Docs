Gene Search
____________

For spatial ATAC data, AtlasXplore can be used to check the gene score of certain gene/genes. The gene score is a prediction of how highly expressed a gene will be based on the accessibility of regulatory elements in the vicinity of the gene.

Access AtlasXplore at https://web.atlasxomics.com/

**Navigating the top bar menu (from left to right)**

To change the heatmap color click the flame icon. 

To upload an ID CSV file, click the up arrow to populate the gene viewer. 

To search any gene ID, type or select in the search bar. Can select as many genes as needed (no limit). Click *Show*.

To view cluster, average of all gene scores, and the name of the gene and its gene activity score hover over any tivel. 
Can select or deselect clusters on the right. 

*Feature table:* Lists top 10 ranked genes in each of the clusters.
