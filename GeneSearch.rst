Gene Search
____________

For spatial ATAC data, AtlasXplore can be used to check the gene score of certain gene/genes. The gene score is a prediction of how highly expressed a gene will be based on the accessibility of regulatory elements in the vicinity of the gene.

Access AtlasXplore at https://web.atlasxomics.com/

Navigating the top bar menu (from left to right)

To switch between the gene and motif datasets click 'GENE'.

To change the background color click the paint pallete icon. 

To change the heatmap color click the flame icon. 

To upload an ID CSV file, click the up arrow to populate the gene viewer. 

To search any gene ID, type or select in the search bar. Can select as many genes as needed (no limit). Click 'Show'.

To view cluster, average of all gene scores, and the name of the gene and its gene activity score hover over any tivel. 
Can select or deselect clusters on the right. 

Feature table: Lists top 10 ranked genes in each of the clusters.

To view the heat map for select genes, click any of the listed genes to automatically enter it in the search bar. If your gene of interest is not listed, you can enter it in the search bar. 
Click the gene in the search bar so that it turns orange and click ‘show’. 
Now you’ll be able to view the heat map for the selected gene and repeat the process to view multiple genes at once.

To view the gene activity score or the sum of the scores, hover over any tixel.
