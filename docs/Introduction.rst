Introduction
__________________________

For spatial ATAC data, AtlasXplore can be used to check the gene score of certain gene/genes. The gene score is a prediction of how highly expressed a gene will be based on the accessibility of regulatory elements in the vicinity of the gene.

**Navigating the Menu**
####################################################

From left to right: 

*Gene Motif:*
Lists the species (mouse, rat, human, etc), Organ, Type, and Run ID. 

To switch between the gene and motif datasets click *GENE*.

To change the background color click the paint pallete icon. 

To change the heatmap color click the flame icon. 

To upload an ID CSV file, click the up arrow to populate the gene viewer. 

To search any gene ID, type or select in the search bar. Can select as many genes as needed (no limit). Click *Show*.

To view cluster, average of all gene scores, and the name of the gene and its gene activity score hover over any tivel. 
Can select or deselect clusters on the right. 

**Feature table** 
####################################################
Lists top 10 ranked genes in each of the clusters. 
The feature table displays the data values as rows, with each row representing a different gene. The columns of the table can include various types of information, such as the name of the feature, the genomic coordinates, and the data values.

The feature table can also be used to sort and filter the data, allowing users to focus on specific subsets of the data and to perform more detailed analyses.

**Clustering**
####################################################
Clustering can be used to group similar features within the genome, such as genes or regulatory elements. This can be useful for identifying groups of genes that are co-regulated or that have similar functions, or for identifying conserved sequence features across multiple species.

To perform clustering, users can use the "Cluster" menu located at the top of the Genome Browser. This menu allows users to specify the data to cluster, the clustering method to use, and any additional options, such as the distance metric and the number of clusters.

Once the clustering has been performed, the results will be displayed in the Genome Browser, with each cluster represented by a different color. Users can then view and analyze the clusters by navigating to different regions of the genome and by using the other tools and features of the Genome Browser.

**Gene Search Tutorial**
###########################
To search for a gene or genomic region, simply enter the name or coordinates in the search bar at the top of the screen and hit enter. The genome browser will automatically navigate to that location and highlight the relevant feature.

For example, if you search for the gene "Rpusd2", the genome browser will navigate to the location of the Rpusd2 gene on the genome and highlight it on the screen. You can then view detailed information about the gene by clicking on it, or compare it to other tracks in your genome browser.

You can also select multiple genes from the search ba, feature table, or by manually clicking and dragging your mouse across the genome browser to create a selection box. This will highlight and display all genes within the selection box, allowing you to easily view and compare multiple genes at the same time.
