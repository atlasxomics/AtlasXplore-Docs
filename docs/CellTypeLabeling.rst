AtlasXplore supports customizing the plots in many different ways, including user defined cell type labeling.

**User-defined cell type labeling**
####################################
User-defined cell type labeling in AtlasXplore allows users to label and classify specific cells or cell types within a data set. This can be useful for identifying and studying the different types of cells present within the data. For example, users can use the cell type labels to identify and compare the expression levels of genes or regulatory elements within different cell types, or to study the spatial relationships between cells and other features within the data set.

User-defined cell type labeling is implemented using a color-coded system. Users can define specific cell types and assign a unique color to each type. The colors are then used to label and classify the cells within the data set.
